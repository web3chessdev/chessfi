## Play Chess. Bet Crypto. Win Big.

ChessFi is a revolutionary web3-based multiplayer chess platform where players can challenge each other and bet cryptocurrency on the outcome of their matches.

## ♟️ How It Works

1. **Challenge a Player**: Send a game request with your chosen crypto betting amount
2. **Accept the Challenge**: Opponents can accept if they agree with the betting terms
3. **Verify Funds**: Smart contracts verify both players have sufficient funds
